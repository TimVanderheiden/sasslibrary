# sasslibrary

This is a Sass project designed to help me round out my experience with Sass.
The idea came from the 7-1 pattern outlined in the sass guidlines https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern
Typography page heavily inspired by Sebastiano Guerriero https://medium.com/codyhouse/create-your-design-system-part-1-typography-7c630d9092bd
